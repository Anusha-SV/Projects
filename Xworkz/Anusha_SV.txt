DESCRIPTIVE

10)  JDK- it stands for java development kit which contains tools 
       JRE-it stands for java run time environment which contains JVM and library. it also provides run time environment to run java file
       JVM- it stands for java virtual machine which complies the java program into byte code.

11)  The perations performed by the jvm are:
       a) it converts the java program into byte code during complilation.
       b) loads the byte code to the memory of the system
       c) it execute the main method
       d) 

12)  Platform Independent means it is the combination of both hardware and software,
       Java is called as platform independent because it undergoes WORA which means write once and run anywhere.
       The code is once written in any operating system and it can be exicuted in any operating system but THE JAVA VERSION MUST BE SAME.

13)  Class is a keyword, class is the declaration of the program.
        It contains body of the program.

14)  Keywords- The inputs are given to the complier by using some predefined functions which are called as keywords
       keywords are existed within the library
       eg: int, long, throws, try etc.

15)  Variables: These are the input value given by the developer and they can vary/change.

16)  Local Variable: The variable which is defined within a body of the method is called Local variable.

17)  Datatypes: The type of data given to the variable is called datatype. there are 8 types
       1. int
       2. float
       3. boolean
       4. double
       5. String
       6. long
       7. short
       8. character

18)  Main method: It is a type of method present in the program. the JVM first complies this method. 
       It is method where actual program runs
       Public static void main(String [] args) - it is the syntax
       where public is "Access specifier"
       static is "Non access specifer"
       void is the "The return type"
       main is "Name of the method"
       (String [] args) is the "parameter"

19)  Static method- It is a type of method it contains 6 parts
           access specifier--access specifier---return type---method name( parameter) throws 


       Syntax:
                    class Test{
                             public static void marks(String subject, Int marks){
                                       
                                     }
                                 }

20)   class Maths{
	public static void evenodd(int value){
		System.out.println("value:"+value);
		if(value>1 && value<3){
			System.out.println("the given value is even");
		}
		else{
			System.out.println("the given value is odd");
		}
	}
	public static void main(String []args){
		Maths.evenodd(2);                      
	}
}
